<center><div class="cus"> This website is made By Mahdi Zaini. This website is for primary school students to study and get ready for 
tests. This is just a project and i doubt anyone will actually use it. My first site made completley from css and html. Eventually ill 
add more programming languages as i learn. The more i add, the better the site looks. </a></div></center>
